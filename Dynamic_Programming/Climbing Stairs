###**_QUESTION_**
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


###**_SOLUTION_**
int climbStairs(int n) {        
  int dp1 = 1, dp2 = 1;
        
  for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
    int dp3 = dp1 + dp2;
            
    dp1 = dp2;
    dp2 = dp3;
  }
        
  return dp2;
}
